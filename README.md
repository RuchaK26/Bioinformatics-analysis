**Author:** Rucha Khumkar  
**Purpose:** Demonstrating beginner-friendly bioinformatics / biomedical data analysis workflow

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple and clear biomedical data analysis workflow using Python.  
Using a patient dataset with features like Glucose, BMI, Age, Blood Pressure, and clinical outcome, the notebook performs:

- Data loading and exploration  
- Data cleaning  
- Group comparison (diabetic vs non-diabetic)  
- Statistical testing (Independent t-test)  
- Meaningful biological interpretation  
- Beautiful visualizations (Boxplot + Heatmap)

This notebook is designed to show problem-solving ability, understanding of biomedical data, and Python analytical skills in a clean and reproducible format.

## 🧬 Dataset Description
The dataset contains clinical features such as:
- Pregnancies  
- Glucose  
- BloodPressure  
- SkinThickness  
- Insulin  
- BMI  
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction  
- Age  
- Outcome (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

📎 Dataset Source: Publicly available diabetes dataset  
(Replace this line with exact source if required)

## 🧠 Statistical Analysis
- Patients were divided into **Outcome = 0 (non-diabetic)** and **Outcome = 1 (diabetic)** groups  
- An independent t-test was performed to check if glucose values differ between groups  
- Result showed **extremely significant difference (p ≈ 8.9 × 10⁻⁴³)**  
- This confirms glucose is a strong distinguishing factor between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals

---

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Boxplot** comparing glucose distribution between Outcome groups  
- **Heatmap** showing correlation among clinical features  

These help in visually understanding feature behavior and relationships.
